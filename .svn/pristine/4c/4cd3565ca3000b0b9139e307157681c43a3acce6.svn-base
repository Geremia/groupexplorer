There are three steps to building GE2 from source:

1. [OPTIONAL] Get the Qt Undo/Redo Framework

Unfortunately, this framework is not open source until Qt4,
but Group Explorer is built on Qt3.  That means QtUndo for Qt3
is only for license holders.

But Group Explorer does not actually NEED QtUndo to work,
it just needs it to give you Undo/Redo capability.  So you can
build GE without Undo/Redo buttons if that's okay with you.
The way to do so is shown at the very end of Step 3, below.

But if you are able to obtain a copy of the Qt Undo/Redo
framework, then after you install it on your machine,
you should edit the GroupExplorer.pro file, and change the line
    include(qtundo.pri)
to be
    include(/path/to/qtundo-1.3-enterprise/src/qtundo.pri)
based on wherever you installed the framework on your machine.

2. Get the Resources directory

In order to save space, I do not include that directory with
the sources, but you can get it from SourceForge, the same
place you got these sources.  (It also comes in every install-
ation of GE on a Mac or Windows machine.)  Put the Resources
directory in the same directory you put the src/ folder (i.e.,
they should be siblings in the directory tree on your machine.)

3. How to build this

Once you have Qt 3.3, the Resources directory, and optionally the
Qt Undo/Redo framework, you follow the standard procedure for
building Qt3-based applications, as follows.  From the directory
containing GroupExplorer.pro (should be the parent directory of
the src/ and Resources/ directories), do these two steps:
    $ qmake -o Makefile GroupExplorer.pro  # this makes a Makefile
    $ make                                 # this does the build
The one change you should make to the above two steps if you don't
have the Qt Undo/Redo Framework is that the first line should
instead read as follows.
    $ qmake -o Makefile "DEFINES += NO_QT_UNDO" GroupExplorer.pro
